# ðŸ“Š Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project is part of my Data Analytics Internship.  
I analyzed a telecom dataset to predict customer churn using Python and machine learning models.

---

## âœ… Project Goal:
Predict which customers are likely to churn (stop using the service).

---

## âœ… Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

---

## âœ… Workflow:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Encoding**
4. **Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)**
5. **Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Recall, ROC AUC)**
6. **Final Conclusion**

---

## âœ… Key Insights:
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
- Tenure, Contract Type, and Internet Service are important features.
- Logistic Regression Model achieved:
  - Accuracy: 82%
  - Recall: 0%
  - ROC AUC Score: 50%

---

## âœ… Conclusion:
Churn can be reduced by offering long-term contracts and improving service quality for fiber optic users.

---

## âœ… Internship:
This project was completed as part of my internship.
